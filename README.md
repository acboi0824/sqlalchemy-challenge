# sqlalchemy-challenge

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following sections outline the steps you must take to accomplish this task.
----------------
### Part 1: Climate Analysis and Exploration

In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to perform basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Complete the following tasks by using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

* Use the provided [starter notebook](climate_starter.ipynb) and [hawaii.sqlite](Resources/hawaii.sqlite) files to complete your climate analysis and data exploration.

* Use SQLAlchemy’s `create_engine` to connect to your SQLite database.

* Use SQLAlchemy’s `automap_base()` to reflect your tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called `Station` and `Measurement`.

* Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.

* **Important:** Don't forget to close out your session at the end of your notebook.
